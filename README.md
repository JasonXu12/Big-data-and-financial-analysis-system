# Big-data-and-financial-analysis-system
I designed a financial analysis system for Chinese NEEQ ( the new third board). This project is based on both front-end and back-end technology. The framework of this project is mainly based on R.
For the back-end, I use mongolite to draw data from anual reports of over 4000 companies in the market. Then the data is processed by Spark. And finally, on the front-end, the result is displayed on web, which is built on shiny.
